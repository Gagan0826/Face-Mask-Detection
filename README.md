# Face-mask-detection
This Program train to detect the face mask with help of openCV,Keras/TensorFlow,
It helps to detect mask on faces in real-time potentially be used to help ensure your safety and the safety of others.

Face mask detection involves the following steps 
first install the reequirements provided

1. Training the model to differentiate between masked faces and unmasked faces
2. Determining the accuracy of the trained model(our model has accuracy of 99%)
3. Setting up another python file to capture the live data through a videostream
4. Loading weights from deploy.protext and caffemodel to identify the face data from the videostream
5. Loading the pre-trained model to classify the data 
6. displaying the result in the livestream
